Camera class implemented 
Ppm image reader implemented

Shapes class and intersection check function implemented 
Architecture BVH implemented


Features from Module1 and Module2 both assembled
antialiasing implemented with jittered sampling for each pixel
Textures implemented. Texture files are in the Textures folder






Correction while integrating:

Cube scale: -1 1 in blender but it was 0,1 in my code so I had to scale it up 

2.  Local color needs to be scaled down by reflectivity and refractivity

3. Sum all the colours from multiples samples in a pixel, average them and clamp. Instead of clamping each sample before even averaging them. 

4. Jittered sampling for each pixel  


pixelToRay used to take tuple<int, int> and it truncates the jittered sampling values. For example, (5.3, 5.2) is converted to (5,5). So I changed it to tuple <float, float>



Modified BVH class because I need it to support tree structure intersection and linear intersection to see how much the intersection can help


In exporter.py, for sphere, changed 'radius': obj.scale.x, to 'radius': obj.dimensions.x / 2.0 for correct dimension calculation 


Stored roughness instead of just shininess for distributed raytracing
