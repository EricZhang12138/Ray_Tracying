Module 1:
- Blender Exporter: Python script (Export.py) to export Scene, Lights, Camera, and Geometry to ASCII.
- Camera Class: Pinhole model with coordinate transformations.
- Image Read/Write: Custom class for reading and writing .ppm format images.

Module 2:
- Ray Intersection: Implemented for Spheres (Object Space), Planes, and Cubes.
- Object-Oriented Shape Hierarchy: Base Shape class with generalized matrix transformations.
- Acceleration Hierarchy: Spatial acceleration structure for optimized rendering.

Module 3:
- Whitted-style Raytracing: Recursive ray tracing for reflections and refractions (dielectrics).
- Blinn-Phong Shading: Local illumination model.
- Antialiasing: Pixel super-sampling/averaging.
- Texture Mapping: UV mapping support using .ppm textures (with robust node-graph traversing in exporter).

Final Raytracer:
- System Integration: Command-line arguments to toggle features/resolution.
- Distributed Raytracing: Soft Shadows (Stochastic light sampling).
- Distributed Raytracing: Glossy Reflections (Roughness-based ray perturbation).
- Lens Effects: Depth of Field (Thin-lens simulation with aperture/focus distance).
- Lens Effects: Motion Blur (Velocity-based temporal sampling).
